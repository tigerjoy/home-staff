# HomeStaff — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement HomeStaff, a digital household workforce management and payroll platform.

## What's Included

### Ready-to-Use Prompts
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

### Instructions
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — 7 milestone instructions (foundation + 6 sections)

### Design Assets
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, design tokens
- `data-model/` — Entity types and sample data
- `shell/` — Application shell components (sidebar, navigation, user menu)
- `sections/` — 6 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
   - Set up design tokens, data model, routing, and shell
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
5. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, RSpec, etc.).

## Sections Overview

| Section | Route | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Staff Directory | `/staff` | Employee profiles, documents, notes |
| Attendance & Holidays | `/attendance` | Present-by-default tracking, holiday rules |
| Payroll & Finance | `/payroll` | Salary calculation, advances, settlements |
| Settings & Access | `/settings` | Household management, member permissions |
| Onboarding & Setup | `/onboarding` | New user wizard (no shell) |
| Employee Portal | `/portal` | Public read-only view for staff |

## Design System

- **Primary Color:** Amber (buttons, links, active states)
- **Secondary Color:** Orange (gradients, accents)
- **Neutral Color:** Stone (backgrounds, text, borders)
- **Typography:** Nunito Sans (headings/body), Fira Code (mono)

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about auth and data modeling
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed
- **Build on your designs** — Use completed sections as the starting point for future features
- **Review thoroughly** — Check plans and implementations carefully
- **Fill in the gaps** — Backend business logic may need manual additions
