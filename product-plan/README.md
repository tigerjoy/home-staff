# HomeStaff — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement HomeStaff.

## What's Included

### Ready-to-Use Prompts
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

### Instructions
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — 9 milestone instructions:
  1. Foundation (design tokens, data model, shell)
  2. Landing Page
  3. User Authentication
  4. Staff Directory
  5. Attendance & Holidays
  6. Payroll & Finance
  7. Settings & Access
  8. Onboarding & Setup
  9. Employee Portal

### Design Assets
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, tokens
- `data-model/` — Core entities and TypeScript types
- `shell/` — Application shell components
- `sections/` — 8 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`) — includes design tokens, data model, routing, and application shell
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes to the prompt
4. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
5. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
6. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, RSpec, Minitest, PHPUnit, etc.).

## Section Overview

| Section | Route | Shell | Description |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Landing Page | `/` | No | Marketing page with hero, features, CTA |
| User Authentication | `/login`, `/register` | No | Social auth, email/password, verification |
| Staff Directory | `/staff` | Yes | Employee profiles, add/edit/archive |
| Attendance & Holidays | `/attendance` | Yes | Present by default, holiday rules |
| Payroll & Finance | `/payroll` | Yes | Salary, advances, payments |
| Settings & Access | `/settings` | Yes | Households, members, permissions |
| Onboarding & Setup | `/onboarding` | No | New user wizard |
| Employee Portal | `/portal` | No | Public staff view via phone |

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about auth and data modeling.
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed.
- **Build on your designs** — Use completed sections as the starting point for future feature development.
- **Review thoroughly** — Check plans and implementations carefully to catch details and inconsistencies.
- **Fill in the gaps** — Backend business logic may need manual additions. Incremental implementation helps you identify these along the way.

## Design System Quick Reference

**Colors:**
- Primary: `amber` — Buttons, links, accents
- Secondary: `orange` — Highlights, gradients
- Neutral: `stone` — Backgrounds, text, borders

**Typography:**
- Heading/Body: Nunito Sans
- Code: Fira Code

**Common Patterns:**
```tsx
// Primary button
className="bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600 text-white rounded-xl px-4 py-2"

// Card
className="bg-white dark:bg-stone-900 rounded-2xl border border-stone-200 dark:border-stone-800 p-6"

// Input
className="bg-stone-50 dark:bg-stone-800 border border-stone-200 dark:border-stone-700 rounded-xl"
```
